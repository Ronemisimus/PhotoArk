# PhotoArk Service Start Script
# This script is intended to be the single point of entry for starting all PhotoArk services.
# It's designed to be idempotent and to handle recovery scenarios in the future.

# --- Future Backup and Restore ---
# The following section is a placeholder for future backup and restore logic.
# Before starting the services, we should check if a backup needs to be restored.
# This could be based on an environment variable or a command-line argument.

# Example placeholder logic:
# if [ "$RESTORE_FROM_BACKUP" = "true" ]; then
#   echo "Restoring from backup..."
#   # Add backup restoration commands here
#   # e.g., ./scripts/restore-db.sh
#   # e.g., ./scripts/restore-s3.sh
# fi

echo "Starting PhotoArk services..."

# Start all services defined in docker-compose.yml in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

echo "PhotoArk services started."

# --- Future Health Checks ---
# After starting the services, we should perform health checks to ensure they are running correctly.
# This could involve polling the health check endpoints of the API and AI services.

# Example placeholder logic:
# ./scripts/health-check.sh
